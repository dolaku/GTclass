# HotRestaurant

* Description: Basic app demonstrating Node and Express with jQuery. Overall purpose is to help schedule reservation requests. Restaurant has just 5 tables available. First five requests get a reservation, every request after that is sent to the waiting list.
* Live Demo: <https://hot-restaurant-fsf.herokuapp.com/>

## Notes

* You will NOT need a MySQL Database for this exercise.
* Current app doesn't have admin handling. We'll deal with that at a later time.
* Don't separate the JavaScript from the HTML in the client-side code. (i.e. Don't use external JavaScript. If you do, you will need an additional line of code to configure the express server to know where the JavaScript is).

## Good luck! Don't stress out

* Spend some time trying to build exposure. But don't get overwhelmed. We'll have plenty of time to come back to this.
